A comprehensive system designed to track, analyze, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for pharmacies. This project features a robust FastAPI-based API for data access and a user-friendly web dashboard for insightful visualizations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **API Endpoints:** Provides a rich set of API endpoints to access calculated KPIs, including sales value, prescription volume, inventory levels, stock-outs, near expiries, cash reconciliation, and top sellers.
* **KPI Analysis API:** A dedicated set of endpoints for in-depth KPI analysis, including daily KPIs, trends, and alerts.
* **Efficient Data Processing:** Leverages Pandas and NumPy for high-performance data loading and preprocessing from CSV files into a MongoDB database.
* **Interactive Web Dashboard:** A simple yet effective web interface (built with Flask and Jinja2) to present key pharmacy metrics in an easily digestible format.
* **Modular Architecture:** Organized into distinct modules for API routers, data processing services, and a dedicated script for seamless data ingestion, promoting maintainability and scalability.

## üåê Multi-Branch Analysis (Planned Extension)

This feature will extend the Pharmacy KPI Project to support operations across multiple pharmacy branches, allowing for comparative insights and optimization at a network level.

### Detailed Explanation of the Multi-Branch Analysis Extension

Multi-Branch Analysis will introduce the ability to track and compare KPIs across different branches. Key components include:

* **Performance Comparison:** Aggregate and contrast metrics like sales, inventory turns, and service levels.
* **Transfer Efficiency:** Monitor inter-branch inventory transfers, evaluating volume, time, cost, and success rate.
* **Identification of Over/Under-Stocked Branches:** Flag branches with excess inventory or shortages using data-driven thresholds.

The extension will build on the existing synthetic dataset by adding a "Branch_ID" or "Branch_Name" field to each record. This will turn the project into a more robust enterprise tool.

### Key Problems and Their Outcomes

This extension targets key challenges faced by multi-branch pharmacies:

* **Uneven Performance Across Branches:**
  * **Problem:** Lack of visibility into why some branches underperform.
  * **Outcomes if Unaddressed:** Inconsistent revenue, inefficient resource allocation, and poor service levels, leading to lost market share.
  * **Mitigation:** Comparative dashboards will highlight variances, enabling targeted interventions.
* **Inefficient Inter-Branch Transfers:**
  * **Problem:** Ad-hoc inventory transfers leading to delays and higher costs.
  * **Outcomes if Unaddressed:** Increased waste from expiries, elevated transportation costs, and supply chain bottlenecks.
  * **Mitigation:** Metrics on transfer success and efficiency will allow for optimization and automation.
* **Over/Under-Stocked Branches:**
  * **Problem:** Lack of centralized monitoring leading to inventory imbalances.
  * **Outcomes if Unaddressed:** Tied-up capital in over-stocked branches and lost sales from under-stocking.
  * **Mitigation:** Automated flagging of inventory imbalances to support rebalancing.

### How It Will Be Implemented

1. **Data Model and Dataset Updates:**
    * Enhance the dataset with a "Branch_ID" and simulate data variations between branches.
    * Update the MongoDB schema to index on "Branch_ID".
2. **API and Router Enhancements:**
    * Add branch query parameters to existing endpoints (e.g., `GET /metrics/sales-value?branch_id=1`).
    * Create new endpoints for performance comparison (e.g., `GET /branches/compare`).
    * Introduce endpoints to manage and analyze inventory transfers.
3. **Business Logic and Services Layer:**
    * Extend calculation functions to group by branch.
    * Add logic for transfer efficiency scoring.
4. **Dashboard and Reporting Updates:**
    * Modify the dashboard to display comparative views and alerts.
    * Add new visualizations for multi-branch trends.
5. **Testing and Integration:**
    * Update tests to cover multi-branch scenarios.
    * Ensure the system is scalable for a large number of branches.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8+**
* **MongoDB:** Install MongoDB and ensure it's running, or have access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pharmacy-kpi.git
    cd pharmacy-kpi
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    * **Windows:**

        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    * **macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (`c:\Users\Ahmed\DEV PROJECTS\pharmacy-kpi\.env`) and add your MongoDB connection string and database name:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/" # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string
    DB_NAME="pharmacy_kpi_db"
    ```

## üí° Usage

### 1. Loading Data

The project includes a convenient script to load your initial CSV data into MongoDB. Ensure your primary dataset (`all_in_one_kpi_dataset.csv`) is placed within the `data/` directory.

```bash
python scripts/load_csv_to_db.py
```

To calculate and load the daily KPIs into the database, run the following script:

```bash
python scripts/load_kpis_to_db.py
```

*Note: If your CSV file has a different name or structure, you may need to modify the scripts accordingly.*

### 2. Running the FastAPI Application

Start the API server using Uvicorn. This will make the KPI data accessible via RESTful endpoints.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. You can explore the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 3. Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard is a separate Flask application that provides a visual overview of the KPIs. While the FastAPI application is running, open a **new terminal**, activate your virtual environment, and run the dashboard app:

```bash
cd reporting
python app.py
```

The dashboard will typically be accessible in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### API Endpoints Overview

The API is structured with various endpoints, each dedicated to a specific category of pharmacy KPIs:

* `/sales`: Sales value and revenue-related KPIs.
* `/rx_volume`: Prescription volume and related metrics.
* `/inventory`: Current inventory levels and stock status.
* `/stock_outs`: Analysis of out-of-stock incidents.
* `/near_expiries`: Products nearing their expiry dates.
* `/cash_reconciliation`: Insights into cash flow and reconciliation.
* `/top_sellers`: Identification of best-selling products.

#### KPI Analysis Endpoints

* `/kpis/daily`: Retrieves the daily KPIs for all branches.
* `/kpis/daily/{branch_id}`: Retrieves the daily KPIs for a specific branch.
* `/kpis/trends`: Provides a trend analysis of KPIs for the last 7 days.
* `/kpis/trends/{branch_id}`: Provides a trend analysis for a specific branch.
* `/kpis/alerts`: Shows alerts for KPIs that have crossed a certain threshold (e.g., stockouts).
* `/kpis/alerts/{branch_id}`: Shows alerts for a specific branch.

For detailed information on each endpoint, including request/response schemas, please refer to the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
